<!--Notes about how chessboard.js works:

va board = ChessBoard('boardId') //For these examples

   General:
        - A board is usually initalized with a cfg object. 
        ex) var board = ChessBoard('board', {
                draggable: true,
                dropOffBoard: 'trash',
                sparePieces: true
                })
        - Events such as onChange, onDrop, onSnapbackEnd, and more are
        availble for use, perhapse a good place for custom game logic.
        - A guide for only allowing legal move exists here: http://chessboardjs.com/examples#5000
        but one can pick and pull from this example. Note on the example's
        "onDrop" function uses a game.move() where game is a "Chess" object.
        To allow for bughouse logic, stand alone logic needs to be written or game.move() 
        needs to be worked with. (The logic for game.move is under "Chess Util Functions"
        in chessboard.js)
   Board:
        - The board's state is contained in a js object where
        the keys are the squares with a piece and the value is
        the piece. Set the board with "board = new ChessBoard('board', FENPositionString)"
        or "board = new ChessBoard('board', positionObject)"
        - For a complicate position (or any with a lot of pieces
        on the board) a FEN string can be used to set the position.
        Basically, this notation describes the board from white's
        perspective, it starts at the top of the board (rank 8) and
        lists the order that the pieces are in for that row, with a 
        number between representing spaces without pieces if there are any,
        then goes down to the bottom (rank 1). ex) Start postion in FEN:
        "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"
        (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation
        for more information)
        - chessboard.js will also store PGN (Portable Game Notation). This
        notation represents the game's state with the moves made in the game.
        (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation for more information.)
        - Orientation is gotten with board.orientation()
        - Orientation is set with board.orientation("white") or 
        board.orientation("black") and flipped with board.flip
        - Board is killed with board.destory

    Pieces:
        - Pieces can be moved by using "board.move()" where board is a 
        ChessBoard and you pass in the piece's location and destination.
        ex) board.move('e2-e4');
        - For multiple pieces at once just pass 2 strings in at once.
        ex) board.move('d2-d4', 'g8-f6');
        - Spare pieces are easily availible by setting "sparePieces" to 
        true in the config. There should be ways we man manually show or hide
        these pieces.
